# TailwindCSS Boilerplate

This is a simple directory with all the files to get started with a [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) project.

## Setup

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract the directory to where you want to use it
3. `cd` into the newly created directory
4. run `npm install`

## Usage

The quickest way to get started is to run

```shell
npm run watch
```

This will run both a browsersync server in watch mode as well as tailwindcli in JIT and watch mode. Your default browser will then launch to `http://localhost:3000/` however, the page can also be accessed with your LAN IP address.
